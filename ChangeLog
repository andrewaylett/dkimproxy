2007-01-26: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * scripts/dkimproxy.in, scripts/dkimproxy.out: do argument-processing
   within Net::Server framework, so it's easier for the user to specify
   additional Net::Server parameters

2006-12-18: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * scripts/dkim_responder.pl: use a Sender header of @messiah.edu so a
   DKIM signature will get added on the reply; include a note in the reply
   about multiple signatures
 * scripts/dkimproxy.out: show how to add DomainKey signatures

2006-10-23: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * configure.ac, INSTALL: dkimproxy now requires 0.20 or better of Mail::DKIM
 * scripts/dkimproxy.in: change dkimfilter.in to dkimproxy.in
 * scripts/dkimproxy.out: change dkimfilter.out to dkimproxy.out;
   support multiple signatures
 * lib/MySmtpProxyServer.pm: no longer prints "running" on startup

2006-10-19: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * scripts/dkim_milter.out: added experimental milter script

2006-09-21: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Released version 0.14, now working on 0.15.

 -- VERSION 0.14 --

2006-09-21: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * init-script.sh: rewrote sample init script; it no longer needs Suse's
   startproc and killproc utilities; it also supports a "status" mode,
   where it reports whether the dkimproxy.in and dkimproxy.out processes
   are still running
 * scripts/dkimproxy.in: support --user, --group, --daemonize arguments
 * scripts/dkimproxy.out: support --user, --group, --daemonize arguments
 * acinclude.m4: created Autoconf macro for checking Perl modules
 * configure.ac: added Perl module checks to configure script

2006-05-26: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Released version 0.13, now working on 0.14.

 -- VERSION 0.13 --

2006-05-26: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM: removed this directory... the Dkim proxy now expects
   the Mail::DKIM module to be installed from CPAN (i.e. it's no longer
   bundled)
 * scripts/dkimproxy.in, scripts/dkimproxy.out: added support for --pidfile
   argument

2006-05-23: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * init-script.sh: sample init script updated to include SLB headers (to
   describe what runlevels dkimproxy should run under)

2006-03-28: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * scripts/dkimproxy.in, scripts/dkimproxy.out: new option "--debug"
   can be specified, which will cause the server to spit out every SMTP
   command it sees to STDERR
 * lib/MySmtpProxyServer.pm: now uses Net::Server::MultiType so that
   different server types (e.g. forking, preforking) can be selected
   at runtime; server type now set to "PreFork" by default; provide
   support for --debug option

2006-02-23: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Now working on version 0.13.

 -- VERSION 0.12 --

2006-02-22: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Key.pm: copied this file from Mail::DomainKeys and
   renamed to Mail::DKIM::Key

2006-02-20: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Algorithm/rsa_sha1.pm: fixed a bug where a missing c=
   tag in the signature was causing an "unsupported canonicalization"
   error
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Canonicalization/relaxed.pm: the latest spec clarifies
   what to do with a space between the header field name and the colon.
   This space is now removed.
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signature.pm: new method "canonicalization", replaces
   "method" method, to access the c= tag. This new method splits the
   value between the header and body canonicalization, filling in the
   defaults if either is not specified.

2005-12-07: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/KeyValueList.pm: common base class for Signature and
   PublicKey, both of which have the same format
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/PublicKey.pm: checks public key to see if it's valid
 * scripts/dkimsign.pl: added documentation and --help argument

2005-12-06: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Now working on version 0.12.
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Common.pm, Verifier.pm: fixed bug in parsing of
   DKIM-Signature header... the capitalization of the field name was not
   being preserved.
 * NEWS, INSTALL, scripts/dkim_responder.pl: replaced occurrences of
   'dkfilter' with 'dkimproxy'

 -- VERSION 0.9 - 0.11 --

2005-12-06: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Added DKIM support.
   (see lib/Mail/DKIM subdirectory)
 * Renamed project to dkimproxy.

2005-07-13: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Released version 0.8, now working on 0.9.

 -- VERSION 0.8 --

2005-07-12: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Makefile.am, configure.ac:
   - yep, I implemented an autoconf/automake-style build system. Now it's
     easy to install anywhere... just do ./configure --prefix=/anywhere &&
	 make install.
 * README, INSTALL:
   - updated this documentation
 * lib/, scripts/:
   - library files have been moved to the lib subdirectory.
   - program files have been moved to the scripts subdirectory. Furthermore,
     program files are now installed under $prefix/bin, so startup scripts
	 will need to be changed.
 * init-script.sh:
   - find filter scripts in /usr/local/dkfilter/bin

2005-06-21: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Released version 0.7, now working on 0.8.

 -- VERSION 0.7 --

2005-06-16: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * dkfilter.in, dkfilter.out:
   - TERM signal handler now "dies", so that the wait system call is properly
     interrupted... I suspect this only needs to happen on Perl 5.8.0+, and
     indeed may not even work with older versions of Perl
   - everything the server does is now enclosed in an eval { } block, so
     that the TERM signal's "die" can be properly caught
   - this fixes a bug where sending the parent process a TERM signal would
     not cause the program to shut down as expected

2005-06-07: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * auto_responder.pl:
   - this is a new Perl script for creating an auto-responding
	 interoperability tester

2005-06-03: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - minor cosmetic change to inline documentation

2005-05-11: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - bugfix - message-parse-error had caused "Odd number of elements..."
     warning to be output by Perl

 -- VERSION 0.6 --

2005-05-10: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - bugfix - use case-INsensitive comparision of sender domain name
     to domain name used to sign
 * dkfilter.out:
   - bugfix - did not check parent domain correctly
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Signature.pm:
   - bugfix - use case-INsensitive comparision of sender domain name
     to domain name found in signature

2005-05-05: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - put an eval { } block around the message verification call, to catch
     and report errors (e.g. DNS errors) during verification
   - for testing mode, changed results to "neutral"

2005-05-04: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Message.pm:
   - fixed canonicalization methods so they can pass the canonicalization
     torturetest
   - added support for generating "h" tag (headers) in signature
   - detect duplicate From: and Sender: headers, but currently nothing is
     done about it when detected
 * dkfilter.out:
   - added command-line argument for turning on "headers" support (--headers)
   - fixed bug where --reject-error was turned on by default (and there was
     no way to turn it off)

2005-04-30: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Key/Public.pm:
   - use ALRM signal to catch a long-running DNS query; currently the timeout
     is 10 seconds; if you're verifying in an After-Queue filter, it should
     be safe to set this timeout higher
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Policy.pm:
   - use ALRM signal to catch a long-running DNS query
 * dkfilter.in, dkfilter.out:
   - fixed another glitch in the way errors were reported

2005-04-29: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - added senderdomain method, to get the host part of the address used
     to sign or verify

2005-04-28: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * dkfilter.out:
   - added "method" command-line argument to specify what canonicalization
     method should be used to sign messages ("simple" or "nofws")
   - "domain" argument can now take multiple domains, separated by commas
   - when signing a message, pick the best matching domain (from the
     "domain" argument) for the address used in the Sender: or From: header

2005-04-27: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - added documentation
 * dkfilter.in:
   - error messages may not have been logged correctly; it should work
     better now
 * init-script.sh:
   - determine FQDN hostname using `hostname -f` and pass it to the
     inbound filter for use in Authentication-Results headers

2005-04-26: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - if signature verification fails, put the reason in the syslog and
     in the Authentication-Results header
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Signature.pm:
   - allow signatures that use a parent domain of the message's from/sender
     domain
