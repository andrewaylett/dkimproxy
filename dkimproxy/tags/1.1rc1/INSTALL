DKIMproxy Requirements
======================

   DKIMproxy is written in Perl. It requires the following Perl modules:

   * Mail::DKIM (version 0.29 or later)
   * Error
   * Net::Server (version 0.91 or later; 0.93, 0.94 and 0.96 are known to work)

   The configure script described below will check for these Perl
   modules, and report an error if not found. You are on your own to
   install them. (Hint: use CPAN.)

   Mail::DKIM can also be downloaded from http://jason.long.name/dkimproxy/,
   which may have a more recent version than CPAN.


Basic Installation
==================

   To install this package:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure --prefix=' followed by the location in which you want
     to install the filter. E.g.

     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/dkimproxy

     You SHOULD specify a --prefix.

  2. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. This will install the filter scripts in $prefix/bin
     and the Perl module files in $prefix/lib.

  3. Create a Unix user/group dedicated to running DKIMproxy. E.g. dkim.

  4. Copy the example configuration files in $prefix/etc.
       dkimproxy_in.conf.example => dkimproxy_in.conf
       dkimproxy_out.conf.example => dkimproxy_out.conf
     Modify the parameters to suit your tastes.

  5. Create a startup/shutdown script for the filter and install it in
     the location normal for your distribution (e.g. /etc/init.d). A
     sample script is provided... you can copy it as /etc/init.d/dkimproxy.
     Be sure to check, and modify if necessary, the user, group, and paths
     found in the script.
