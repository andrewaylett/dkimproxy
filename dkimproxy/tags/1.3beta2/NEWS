This file summarizes what's changed between releases of dkimproxy.
See the ChangeLog file for the details.

Version 1.3

 * Fixed a bug in how signatures were generated when no "method" option
   is specified.
 * Added options "dkim_method" and "domainkeys_method" to supercede the
   existing "method" option; these options are specific to the DKIM and
   DomainKeys signatures.

 - beta 1

 * Added support for the "listid_map" option, which will generate
   signatures based on the "List-Id" header. This feature sponsored
   by Nguyen Tam Chinh and Damir Simunic.


Version 1.2 - released 2009-07-12

 * Man pages are now generated for dkimproxy.in and dkimproxy.out.
   (They may not be installed at the right place, though.)

 - beta 2

 * Inbound filter now processes DomainKeys signer policies in
   addition to DKIM signer policies

 - beta 1

 * Fixed a bug in dkimproxy.out where domain matching was done with
   a case sensitive string match. Domains should be case-insensitive.
 * Implemented some (but not complete) IPv6 support.
 * Initial support for controlling the i= (identity) tag of signatures.


Version 1.1 - released 2008-10-23

 - release candidate 2

 * Copyright/permission notices have been clarified on several files
   that make up this project. It should now be clear this project is
   GPL2 or later.

 - release candidate 1

 * Fixed a bug in dkimproxy.in where DomainKey signatures were not
   reported correctly in the Authentication-Results header. I.e.
   Authentication-Results header now report "domainkeys=pass"
   and "header.from=whatever" for DomainKeys signatures.
 * Better error-handling for when the relay host is down or
   syslog is down (the error is reported to the client via SMTP
   before the connection is terminated).


Version 1.0.1 - released 2008-02-08

 * Fixed a bug where the "key" parameter didn't work in a sender_map
   file.


Version 1.0 - released 2008-02-01

 - beta2

 * Sender-dependent maps are now read into memory at startup.
   If you make a change to a map, you will need to restart dkimproxy.

 - beta1

 UPGRADERS TAKE NOTE!
   Please check the included RELEASE_NOTES for what to watch out for
   when upgrading to 1.0+.

 * Added support for configuration files
 * Added support for specifying multiple signatures
 * Added support for sender-dependent configurations


Version 0.16 - released 2007-05-24

 * Fixed a bug where --max_servers and --min_servers still were not
   recognized as valid parameters.
 * Use new "pretty signatures" feature if Mail::DKIM 0.25 or better
   is installed. (This makes all generated signatures line wrapped.)


Version 0.15 - released 2007-03-02

 * The signer can now output DomainKeys signatures instead of DKIM signatures.
 * The online help (see dkimproxy.in --help or dkimproxy.out --help) has
   been improved quite a bit.
 * The dkimproxy daemons accept all options documented in Perl module
   Net::Server::PreFork. E.g. --max_servers, --min_servers.


Version 0.14 - released 2006-09-21

 * The sample init script has been rewritten; it should now work on Linux
   distributions other than Suse.


Version 0.13 - released 2006-05-26

 UPGRADERS TAKE NOTE!
   If you have installed version 0.12 (or lower) of DKIM proxy,
   please delete the $prefix/lib/Mail/DKIM directory before upgrading.

 * Mail::DKIM is now a separate download, so please download it (from
   the same location as dkimproxy is available) and install it
   separately. Mail::DKIM version 0.17 includes support for draft ietf-01
   of the DKIM specification.
 * Some tweaks have been made to the init script, and a new argument
   --pidfile can be specified to create a PID file on startup.
 * Fixed an issue where only one SMTP client could be connected at a time.


Version 0.12 - released 2006-02-23

 * A few bugs were fixed with regard to DKIM specifications.
 * Mail::DomainKeys is no longer needed, and no longer included with the
   dkimproxy package.


Version 0.11 - released 2005-12-06

 * Renamed to dkimproxy
 * DKIM draft 01 now supported (report bugs, please)


Version 0.10 (not released)

 * Incremental signing/verifying is now implemented in the DKIM filter;
   as a result, the Crypt::RSA Perl module is now required, in addition
   to Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA. Requiring both of these modules was not
   desired, but so far it seems necessary.


Version 0.9 - released 2005-10-28

 * Started working on DKIM support. The signing process appears to be
   more-or-less complete (at least until the next revision of the DKIM
   drafts), but has received very little testing. I recommend against
   putting this into production.
 * DKIM verification support is rudimentary as well. Once again, I must
   recommend against using it in production.
 * No changes to the DomainKeys signing and verification, so there's
   no reason for users to upgrade.


Version 0.8 - released 2005-07-13

 * Implemented an autoconf/automake build system. The recommended install can
   now be achieved with:
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/dkfilter
     make install
 * The filter scripts, dkfilter.in and dkfilter.out, are now installed to
   $(prefix)/bin, e.g. /usr/local/dkfilter/bin/. This is different than
   before, so if upgrading make the appropriate adjustments to your startup
   script.


Version 0.7 - released 2005-06-21

 * Fixed a bug where the TERM signal was not properly handled.
 * Includes auto_responder.pl, a Perl script for creating an auto-resonding
   interoperability tester


Version 0.6 - released 2005-06-02

 * Fixed a few bugs with message parsing and domain comparisons


Version 0.5 - released 2005-05-05

 * The "simple" and "nofws" canonicalization routines are now able to pass
   the "torture tests" provided on http://domainkeys.sourceforge.net
 * Support generation of "h" tag (headers) when creating a signature.
   To use, add --headers to the command-line arguments of dkfilter.out.
 * Failed signatures for domains in "testing mode" will result in a "neutral"
   result, rather than "softfail".
 * DNS time-outs now get reported in the Authentication-Results header,
   unless "--reject-errors" is being used, in which case the message is
   not even accepted.


Version 0.4 - released 2005-05-02

 * DNS queries now have a 10-second timeout, which prevents the SMTP proxy
   from taking too long to respond to Postfix


Version 0.3 - released 2005-04-29

 * you can now specify a canonicalization method; use the --method argument:
   either --method=simple or --method=nofws
 * the signer can now be responsible for multiple source domains; simply
   specify the domains separated by commas on the --domain argument,
   e.g. --domain=example.org,example.com


Version 0.2 - released 2005-04-27

 * fixed a minor logging bug
 * include better reasons for why verification fails in the
   Authentication-Results header
 * now properly verifies a signature that uses a parent domain of the
   domain in the from/sender address


Version 0.1 - released 2005-04-26

 * initial release
