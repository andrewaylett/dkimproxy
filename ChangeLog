 * Released version 0.8, now working on 0.9.

 -- VERSION 0.8 --

2005-07-12: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Makefile.am, configure.ac:
   - yep, I implemented an autoconf/automake-style build system. Now it's
     easy to install anywhere... just do ./configure --prefix=/anywhere &&
	 make install.
 * README, INSTALL:
   - updated this documentation
 * lib/, scripts/:
   - library files have been moved to the lib subdirectory.
   - program files have been moved to the scripts subdirectory. Furthermore,
     program files are now installed under $prefix/bin, so startup scripts
	 will need to be changed.
 * init-script.sh:
   - find filter scripts in /usr/local/dkfilter/bin

 * Released version 0.7, now working on 0.8.

 -- VERSION 0.7 --

2005-06-16: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * dkfilter.in, dkfilter.out:
   - TERM signal handler now "dies", so that the wait system call is properly
     interrupted... I suspect this only needs to happen on Perl 5.8.0+, and
     indeed may not even work with older versions of Perl
   - everything the server does is now enclosed in an eval { } block, so
     that the TERM signal's "die" can be properly caught
   - this fixes a bug where sending the parent process a TERM signal would
     not cause the program to shut down as expected

2005-06-07: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * auto_responder.pl:
   - this is a new Perl script for creating an auto-responding
	 interoperability tester

2005-06-03: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - minor cosmetic change to inline documentation

2005-05-11: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - bugfix - message-parse-error had caused "Odd number of elements..."
     warning to be output by Perl

 -- VERSION 0.6 --

2005-05-10: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - bugfix - use case-INsensitive comparision of sender domain name
     to domain name used to sign
 * dkfilter.out:
   - bugfix - did not check parent domain correctly
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Signature.pm:
   - bugfix - use case-INsensitive comparision of sender domain name
     to domain name found in signature

2005-05-05: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - put an eval { } block around the message verification call, to catch
     and report errors (e.g. DNS errors) during verification
   - for testing mode, changed results to "neutral"

2005-05-04: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Message.pm:
   - fixed canonicalization methods so they can pass the canonicalization
     torturetest
   - added support for generating "h" tag (headers) in signature
   - detect duplicate From: and Sender: headers, but currently nothing is
     done about it when detected
 * dkfilter.out:
   - added command-line argument for turning on "headers" support (--headers)
   - fixed bug where --reject-error was turned on by default (and there was
     no way to turn it off)

2005-04-30: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Key/Public.pm:
   - use ALRM signal to catch a long-running DNS query; currently the timeout
     is 10 seconds; if you're verifying in an After-Queue filter, it should
     be safe to set this timeout higher
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Policy.pm:
   - use ALRM signal to catch a long-running DNS query
 * dkfilter.in, dkfilter.out:
   - fixed another glitch in the way errors were reported

2005-04-29: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - added senderdomain method, to get the host part of the address used
     to sign or verify

2005-04-28: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * dkfilter.out:
   - added "method" command-line argument to specify what canonicalization
     method should be used to sign messages ("simple" or "nofws")
   - "domain" argument can now take multiple domains, separated by commas
   - when signing a message, pick the best matching domain (from the
     "domain" argument) for the address used in the Sender: or From: header

2005-04-27: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - added documentation
 * dkfilter.in:
   - error messages may not have been logged correctly; it should work
     better now
 * init-script.sh:
   - determine FQDN hostname using `hostname -f` and pass it to the
     inbound filter for use in Authentication-Results headers

2005-04-26: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * DKMessage.pm:
   - if signature verification fails, put the reason in the syslog and
     in the Authentication-Results header
 * Mail/DomainKeys/Signature.pm:
   - allow signatures that use a parent domain of the message's from/sender
     domain
