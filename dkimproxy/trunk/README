This is dkfilter, an SMTP-proxy that implements DomainKeys message signing
and verification.  It is designed to work with Postfix, but since it only
speaks SMTP, it could potentially work with any MTA, not just Postfix.  It
comprises two separate filters, an "outbound" filter for signing outgoing
email, and an "inbound" filter for verifying signatures of incoming email.
The filters can operate as either Before-Queue or After-Queue Postfix
content filters.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Dkfilter is based on smtpprox and Mail::DomainKeys. My thanks go out to
Bennett Todd for providing smtpprox and Anthony D. Urso for providing
Mail::DomainKeys.
