About
=====

DKIMproxy is an SMTP-proxy that implements the DKIM and DomainKeys
standards, to sign and verify email messages using digital signatures
and DNS records. It can be used to add DKIM support to nearly any
existing SMTP mail server. The included instructions show how to
integrate it with Postfix.  It comprises two separate proxies, an
"outbound" proxy for signing outgoing email, and an "inbound" proxy for
verifying signatures of incoming email. With Postfix, the proxies can
operate as either Before-Queue or After-Queue content filters.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions. Or, check the
website at http://dkimproxy.sourceforge.net/.

DKIMproxy has evolved from my earlier project, Dkfilter. It is based on
smtpprox and Mail::DomainKeys. My thanks go out to Bennett Todd for
providing smtpprox and Anthony D. Urso for providing Mail::DomainKeys.
