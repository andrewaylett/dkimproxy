DKIMproxy Requirements
======================

   DKIMproxy is written in Perl. It requires the following Perl modules:

   * Mail::DKIM (version 0.29 or later)
   * Error
   * Net::Server (version 0.91 or later; 0.93, 0.94 and 0.96 are known to work)

   The configure script described below will check for these Perl
   modules, and report an error if not found. You are on your own to
   install them. (Hint: use CPAN.)

   Mail::DKIM can also be downloaded from http://jason.long.name/dkimproxy/,
   which may have a more recent version than CPAN.


Basic Installation
==================

   To install this package:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure --prefix=' followed by the location in which you want
     to install the filter. E.g.

     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/dkimproxy

     You SHOULD specify a --prefix.

  2. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. This will install the filter scripts in $prefix/bin
     and the Perl module files in $prefix/lib.

  3. Create a Unix user/group dedicated to running DKIMproxy. E.g. dkim.

  4. Copy the example configuration files in $prefix/etc.
       dkimproxy_in.conf.example => dkimproxy_in.conf
       dkimproxy_out.conf.example => dkimproxy_out.conf
     Modify the parameters to suit your tastes.

  5. Create a startup/shutdown script for the filter and install it in
     the location normal for your distribution (e.g. /etc/init.d). A
     sample script is provided... you can copy it as /etc/init.d/dkimproxy.
     Be sure to check, and modify if necessary, the user, group, and paths
     found in the script.



DKIMproxy Setup
===============

   To create signatures, you will need to generate a private/public key
   pair using OpenSSL. The following two commands generate two files:
   private.key and public.key, containing the private and public keys
   in Base64 format:

       openssl genrsa -out private.key 1024
       openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key

   Modify the permissions on private.key so that only the DKIMproxy user
   can read it (the user created in step 3 above).

   Pick a selector name... e.g. "selector1".

   Put the public-key data in DNS, in your domain, using the selector
   name you picked. Take the contents of the public.key file and remove
   the PEM header and footer, and concatenate the lines of the file
   into one big line. Then create a TXT entry, like this:

   selector1._domainkey    IN  TXT  "k=rsa; t=s; p=MHwwDQYJK ... OprwIDAQAB"

   where selector1 is the name of the selector chosen above and the p=
   parameter contains the public-key as one long string of characters.


   More information on setting up DKIMproxy is currently only available
   online.
   See http://dkimproxy.sourceforge.net/ for the details.
