This file summarizes what's changed between releases of dkfilter.
See the ChangeLog file for the details.

Version 0.11 - released 2005-12-06

 * Renamed to dkimproxy
 * DKIM draft 01 now supported (report bugs, please)

Version 0.10 (not released)

 * Incremental signing/verifying is now implemented in the DKIM filter;
   as a result, the Crypt::RSA Perl module is now required, in addition
   to Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA. Requiring both of these modules was not
   desired, but so far it seems necessary.

Version 0.9 - released 2005-10-28

 * Started working on DKIM support. The signing process appears to be
   more-or-less complete (at least until the next revision of the DKIM
   drafts), but has received very little testing. I recommend against
   putting this into production.
 * DKIM verification support is rudimentary as well. Once again, I must
   recommend against using it in production.
 * No changes to the DomainKeys signing and verification, so there's
   no reason for users to upgrade.

Version 0.8 - released 2005-07-13

 * Implemented an autoconf/automake build system. The recommended install can
   now be achieved with:
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/dkfilter
     make install
 * The filter scripts, dkfilter.in and dkfilter.out, are now installed to
   $(prefix)/bin, e.g. /usr/local/dkfilter/bin/. This is different than
   before, so if upgrading make the appropriate adjustments to your startup
   script.

Version 0.7 - released 2005-06-21

 * Fixed a bug where the TERM signal was not properly handled.
 * Includes auto_responder.pl, a Perl script for creating an auto-resonding
   interoperability tester

Version 0.6 - released 2005-06-02

 * Fixed a few bugs with message parsing and domain comparisons

Version 0.5 - released 2005-05-05

 * The "simple" and "nofws" canonicalization routines are now able to pass
   the "torture tests" provided on http://domainkeys.sourceforge.net
 * Support generation of "h" tag (headers) when creating a signature.
   To use, add --headers to the command-line arguments of dkfilter.out.
 * Failed signatures for domains in "testing mode" will result in a "neutral"
   result, rather than "softfail".
 * DNS time-outs now get reported in the Authentication-Results header,
   unless "--reject-errors" is being used, in which case the message is
   not even accepted.

Version 0.4 - released 2005-05-02

 * DNS queries now have a 10-second timeout, which prevents the SMTP proxy
   from taking too long to respond to Postfix

Version 0.3 - released 2005-04-29

 * you can now specify a canonicalization method; use the --method argument:
   either --method=simple or --method=nofws
 * the signer can now be responsible for multiple source domains; simply
   specify the domains separated by commas on the --domain argument,
   e.g. --domain=example.org,example.com

Version 0.2 - released 2005-04-27

 * fixed a minor logging bug
 * include better reasons for why verification fails in the
   Authentication-Results header
 * now properly verifies a signature that uses a parent domain of the
   domain in the from/sender address

Version 0.1 - released 2005-04-26

 * initial release
