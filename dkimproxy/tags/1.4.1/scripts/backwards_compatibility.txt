in major release 0,

the administrator would specify a list of all domains which
the server had the private key for

dkimproxy would look at a message, decide:
 1) whether the message could be signed, and if so,
 2) which domain to use

in both cases the decision is based on the message's sender


in major release 1,

the administrator can use a sender-dependent configuration map,
in which case we always know which domain to use in the signature

or he can specify a single domain on the command-line,
in which case we always use that domain

or he can specify multiple domains on the command-line
(needed for backward-compatibility),
in which case we select the domain to use based on the message sender
(as before) and sign using only that domain
