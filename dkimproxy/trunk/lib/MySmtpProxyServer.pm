# handle_end_of_data
#
# Called when the source finishes transmitting the message. This method
# may filter the message and if desired, transmit the message to
# $client. Alternatively, this method can respond to the server with
# some sort of rejection (temporary or permanent).
#
# Usage: $result = handle_end_of_data($server, $client);
#
# Returns:
#   nonzero if a message was transmitted to the next server and its response
#     returned to the source server
#   zero if the message was rejected and the connection to the next server
#     should be dropped
