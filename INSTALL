Dkimproxy Requirements
======================

   Dkimproxy is written in Perl. It requires the following Perl modules:

   * Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA
   * Mail::Address
   * MIME::Base64
   * Net::DNS
   * Test::More
   * Crypt::RSA
   * Net::Server
   * Digest::SHA1

   The configure script described below does NOT check for these Perl
   modules. You are on your own to install them.


Basic Installation
==================

   To install this package:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
	 `./configure --prefix=' followed by the location in which you want
	 to install the filter. E.g.

	 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/dkfilter

  2. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. This will install the filter scripts in $prefix/bin
	 and the Perl module files in $prefix/lib.

  3. Create a Unix user/group dedicated to running Dkimproxy. E.g. dkfilter.

  4. Create a startup/shutdown script for the filter and install it in
     the location normal for your distribution (e.g. /etc/init.d). A
	 sample script is provided... make sure to check, and modify if
	 necessary, the user, group, and paths found in the script. Also,
	 you'll want to adjust the command-line arguments used to start
	 the filters, as this is how to configure Dkfilter.


Dkimproxy Setup
===============

   Information on setting up dkimproxy is currently only available online.
   See http://jason.long.name/dkimproxy/ for the details.
