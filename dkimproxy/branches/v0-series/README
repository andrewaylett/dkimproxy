Dkimproxy is an SMTP-proxy that signs and/or verifies Domain Keys
Identified Mail (DKIM). It is designed for Postfix. It comprises two
separate proxies, an "outbound" proxy for signing outgoing email, and
an "inbound" proxy for verifying signatures of incoming email. With
Postfix, the proxies can operate as either Before-Queue or After-Queue
content filters.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions. Or, check the website

Dkimproxy has evolved from my earlier project, Dkfilter. It is based on
smtpprox and Mail::DomainKeys. My thanks go out to Bennett Todd for
providing smtpprox and Anthony D. Urso for providing Mail::DomainKeys.
