This is a place for me to think about config file formats for dkimproxy...

The process
 - consider an incoming message for signing
 - look at the message attributes, e.g.
   - from/sender headers
   - client IP address
   - SASL logon
 - if the message is worthy of signing, construct one or more signatures
   with certain attributes
 - sign the message with those signatures

So the config file could consist of a list of rules. Each rule
has "conditions" of the message to be signed, and "actions" consisting
of signatures to add. Each action specifies the signature attributes
to use.

----------
Example A:
----------

[messiah.edu]
keyfile=/usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
selector=alpha
method=relaxed

[example.org]
keyfile=/usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
selector=alpha
method=relaxed

  Config to use is based on sender domain. Common config elements must be
  duplicated in each section. Not possible to have multiple signatures.

----------
Example B:
----------

$selector = "alpha";
$method = "relaxed";
$keyfile = "/usr/local/dkfilter/private.key";

if ($sender =~ /messiah\.edu$/) {
  add_signature(domain => "messiah.edu");
}

  This mechanism could provide a lot of flexibility, but is probably harder
  and more complicated to implement. The mechanism for selecting a message
  based on sending domain is a little messy, considering how common it will
  be for people to want to do this.

----------
Example C:
----------

# global options
method relaxed;

group {
  keyfile /usr/local/dkfilter/private.key;
  selector alpha;
  domain messiah.edu;
}
group {
  keyfile /usr/local/dkfilter/other.key;
  selector beta;
  domain example.org;
}

  This is ISC config file format... pretty nice mechanism for expressing
  common options, but I'm not sure how to express the "actions" i.e. when
  to generate a signature and when not to.

  Is the "domain messiah.edu" declaring an attribute of the signature,
  or a condition? In this case, both.

----------
Example D:
----------

method=relaxed
WHEN domain == messiah.edu:
  keyfile=/usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
  selector=alpha
  ADD-SIGNATURE
WHEN domain == example.org:
  keyfile=/usr/local/dkfilter/other.key
  selector=beta
  ADD-SIGNATURE

----------
Example E:
----------

method=relaxed
BEGIN-GROUP
  keyfile=/usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
  selector=alpha
  BEGIN-RULE
    CONDITION: sender's domain is "messiah.edu"
    ACTION: add DKIM-Signature
    ACTION: add DomainKey-Signature
  END-RULE
END-GROUP
BEGIN-GROUP
  keyfile=/usr/local/dkfilter/other.key
  selector=beta
  BEGIN-RULE
    CONDITION: sender's domain is "example.org"
	ACTION: add DomainKey-Signature
  END-RULE
END-GROUP

  This is the general idea I'm going for, but it seems too much like I'm
  inventing a new programming language.

----------
Example F:
----------

<Signature-Template A>
  Version   DKIM
  Method    relaxed
  Algorithm rsa-sha256
  KeyFile   /usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
  Selector  alpha
</Signature-Template>
<Sender-Domain "messiah.edu">
  Add-Signature A
</Sender-Domain>

  Trying an Apache-style format, using a "template" concept.

Method    relaxed
Algorithm rsa-sha256
<Group>
  KeyFile  /usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
  Selector alpha
  <MessageMatch>
    Allow sender messiah.edu
	Add-Signature DomainKeys
    Add-Signature DKIM
  </MessageMatch>
</Group>
<MessageMatch>
  KeyFile  /usr/local/dkfilter/other.key
  Selector beta
  Allow sender messiah.edu
  Add-Signature DomainKeys
</MessageMatch>

----------
Example G:
----------

Messiah's simple config:

  selector selector1
  method   relaxed
  keyfile  /usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
  domain   messiah.edu

Simple ISP config, supporting many domains, same config for each:

  selector selector1
  method   relaxed
  keyfile  /usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
  domain   example.org
  domain   example.com
  domain   mydomain1.example
  domain   mydomain2.example

Simple config for Messiah to output two signatures:

  <signature>
	version  DKIM
    selector selector1
    method   relaxed
    keyfile  /usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
    domain   messiah.edu
  </signature>
  <signature>
	version  DomainKeys
    selector selector1
    method   relaxed
    keyfile  /usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
    domain   messiah.edu
  </signature>

or

  selector selector1
  method   relaxed
  keyfile  /usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
  domain   messiah.edu
  <signature>
	version  DKIM
  </signature>
  <signature>
	version  DomainKeys
  </signature>

----------
Example H:
----------

  [messiah.edu]
  signature.1=DKIM
  selector.1=selector1
  method.1=relaxed
  keyfile.1=/usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
  signature.2=DomainKey
  selector.2=selector1
  method.2=relaxed
  keyfile.2=/usr/local/dkfilter/private.key

----------
Example I:
----------

  domain[messiah.edu].signature[1]=DKIM
  domain[messiah.edu].selector[1]=selector1
  domain[messiah.edu].method[1]=relaxed
  domain[messiah.edu].keyfile[1]=/usr/local/dkfilter/private.key
